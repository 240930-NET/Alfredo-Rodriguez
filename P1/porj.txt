IDEAS:
1. Some sort fo rankdle type game for valorant/rocket league?
2. stat tracker for a game?
3. Some databse type site where you can see all enemies or stuff like that from a JRPG
4. Could make a game where you input a bunch of stuff and then you play against or with the stuff you input
5. Music playlist type app (maybe music download as well)
6. Simple jrpg type game?


7. (MAIN IDEA FOR NOW) Steam Game Backlog app (retrieves games from steam api but stores user information on database) https://steamcommunity.com/dev
save info for user: (username, password, secret?, steamid maybe?)
save backlogs(games, user they belong to?)
might have to save individual games they own too just so we can apply the "completed", "in progress", "niot started" etc status
save games(name, completion status, description?, playtime which can automatically set certain statuses, img, id)
